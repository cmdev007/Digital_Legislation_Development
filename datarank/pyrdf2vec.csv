"Bhopal: Police in Madhya Pradesh's Bhind district on Saturday registered a case against executive directors of Amazon India after busting a racket which allegedly sold ganja (cannabis) under the guise of selling a sweetener through the e-commerce platform. Amazon had said in a statement earlier that it does not allow sale of illegal products through its platform, and it was cooperating with the probe in the matter.  A case under section 38 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act was registered against executive directors of Amazon India which operates as ASSL in the country, Bhind Superintendent of Police Manoj Kumar Singh told PTI. The FIR did not mention any individual official by name, he said. Section 38 deals with the role of companies and their managements in an offence related to narcotic substances. A case was registered under the NDPS Act at Gohad police station in the district on November 13 after 21.7 kilograms of ganja was seized from Gwalior residents Bijendra Tomar and Suraj alias Kallu Pawaiya, the SP said.  Their questioning led to the arrest of Mukul Jaiswal, another Gwalior resident, and purchaser Chitra Balmiki, a resident of Mehgaon in Bhind, he said.

"Hyderabad: Increasing cases of fuel thefts from parked trucks on highways have become a headache for the drivers and the owners alike. According to truck owners, a group of muggers break the fuel tank lock open and steal diesel using small pipes while the tired drivers are taking naps. As the Covid-19 restrictions have been eased, hundreds of trucks are moving along highways on a daily basis. The truck owners alleged that more than 50 such incidents of diesel thefts were taking place every day.  As per the statistics provided by the truck owners’ association, there are around 1.5 trucks and lorries in the state. Each lorry has a fuel tank with a capacity of 400 litres. Abdul Bari, member of Telangana Lorry Owners’ Association, who also owns lorries, said, “On Sunday, two of my lorries were targeted by these crooks in Peddapalli, on a highway, wherein around hundred litres of fuel was stolen.”
“More such incidents are taking place on the highways of Vijayawada and Warangal. The gangs which are involved in these activities are mostly from UP and Bihar. While trucks are parked, a small vehicle is intentionally parked beside these trucks. They insert a pipe in the tank by breaking its lock and fuel is sucked by the help of a motor. The whole process happens within minutes,” he said and added, “If the driver comes to know about the theft, these crooks attack the driver.”  Manchireddy Rajendar Reddy, president of this association, said such thefts are also committed by tea stall owners on highways. Some tea stalls that serve tea when these trucks are stopped, spike the tea and once the driver dozes, they empty half of the tank. Recently, two of such offenders have been apprehended by the police.” “These trucks basically generate revenue for the government as toll is paid for most of the routes. The authorities should provide safe parking areas for these trucks and lorries ensuring security and safety,” Rajendar Reddy said. ","['275', '323', '108', '124', '139A']"
"HYDERABAD: It was an unprecedented hearing that the Telangana High Court witnessed on Thursday laced with heated arguments when it took up the anticipatory bail petition of IAS trainee Mrugender Lal Banoth who has been charged with alleged rape of a woman at the National Police Academy (NPA) ending up with photos of a woman, said to be in the buff, being circulated leaving the victim in a state of shame and helplessness. However, on the request of the accused’s counsel that the future of the trainee officer will be at stake if he is arrested, Justice Lalitha granted 15-day interim bail ordering him to cooperate with the interrogation. The court also directed him to undergo a potency test.  The victim`s implead petition requesting the court to take up her contentions, too, before granting bail led to a twist in case. On Wednesday, Bhanoth’s counsel Devineni Radha Rani had argued that the rape case was lodged against her client as a counterblast by the victim as she was earlier booked in a case for circulating photos, allegedly in the nude, of the accused’s relative (woman) in a Telegram group she had created. The court was seeking the status of the case from the police. On Thursday, the police told the court that the phones and other electronic equipment with the obscene photos have been seized and sent to the forensic science laboratory (FSL) and a report was awaited. The police also submitted that seven witness were also examined in the rape case and they could not take further steps due to the court’s directions not to take any coercive steps against the accused.  Soon after, victim’s counsel S. Rajagopal stated that Bhanoth and his family were trying to mislead the court by cooking up a case against the victim and that photos purportedly in circulation were of the victim herself and not of Bhanoth’s cousin’s. He also submitted that before the case was registered against his client, Bhanoth’s father and former MLA Madan Lal and his wife visited the victim at her house to work out a compromise on two occasions. At this point, Bhanoth’s Counsel placed photos of the woman along with text messages and submitted that the victim impersonated as a male member of the Telegram group, and was forwarding photos of herself saying that it belongs to Bhanoth’s cousin.  Taking her defence further, she also quoted a Supreme Court observation that consensual sex with a promise of marriage does not amount to rape. Victim’s Counsel Rajagopal raised an objection and said that the Bhanoth’s Counsel was indulging in character assassination leadihg to some heated arguments. Interfering at this juncture, Justice Kanneganti Lalitha enquired with Assistant Public Prosecutor Md Vizarat about the FSL report. The Judge also questioned Bhanoth’s Counsel as to how a woman can circulate her own obscene photos and blame others. “Does any woman do such things?” She also asked, “What is the conduct of the trainee officer? Being a IPS trainee how could he go in for consensual sex and that too a the place of training? How will he go on to serve?”  The APP submitted that the FSL report would take time but submitted that the phone number from which the photos were forwarded was not in the name of the victim. However, the police had also booked another person as the second accused who had earlier used the same number. The APP also submitted that these two cases cannot be linked and citing a Supreme Court case said that the IAS trainee’s conduct amounts to rape and appealed to the court not to grant bail. Giving relief to Bhanoth’s parents, the court directed the police to issue notices to the parents if their presence is required. ","['352', '371D', '75', '360', '239B']"

"HYDERABAD: Justice Lalitha Kanneganti of Telangana High Court on Friday granted bail to Saranala Sreedhar Rao, the ‘tainted’ managing director of Sandhya Conventions and Constructions & Estates Private Limited. This is the second High Court respite for the realtor in three days.  Rao was arrested in Bangalore by Telangana police on November 17 following a FIR lodged against him on a complaint by Chaithanya Krishna Murthy Gogineni, a designator partner of Rowa & Company Associates LLP at Raidurgam police station. He alleged that the petitioner has sold two office units in Sandhya Techno-1 and later the same was encroached upon by the petitioners after joining hands with Incredible India Projects Pvt Ltd. Rao approached the High Court on Thursday, for bail under Section 439 of CrPC. However, in the absence of the remand report, the petition was adjourned to Friday.  Justice Lalitha expressed displeasure at the functioning of the investigation officer of Raidurgam police station, who, in violation of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, took custody of Rao. The judge advised the public prosecutor, Prathap Reddy to urge senior police officials to sensitise their staff about the Criminal Procedure Code. M.S. Prasad, senior counsel representing the petitioner, complained about the highhanded behaviour of the police. He said that the petitioner was arrested in Bangalore by police in civil dress without following due procedures. He expressed fears that PT warrants could be issued against his client.  Meanwhile, public prosecutor Pratap Reddy argued that the bail petition itself was not maintainable. But as the court was inclined to hear the case on its merits, he said that there are 17 other cases and complaints against the petitioner, including allegations of cheating people. The police had no other option but to arrest him immediately. He also submitted that the petitioner was absconding from the time he got the first court relief. Justice Lalitha wondered why the petitioner was not arrested without issuing 41a notice when there were criminal antecedents. She took note of the fact that the Raidurgam inspector had served notice and arrested the petitioner on the same day in another case and that the concerned magistrate had rejected the remand faulting police.  The judge said “The conduct of the inspector makes it clear that he is unaware of the criminal procedure and Supreme Court guidelines in the Arnesh Kumar case”. The judge directed the Inspector to file a counter, responding to the violations.","['134A', '134', '258A', '109', '217']"

The report also revealed that double registrations were done on the property at two sub-registrar offices.

In the internal report, the bank officials found fault with Govind Katroth for his reckless financing by violating norms of the bank. Katroth failed to comply with the bank's guidelines in recommending, disbursing and monitoring the loan sanctioned to Amazon Enterprises, it was found.  ""Govind did not ensure that the unit was established and failed to conduct post-sanction unit inspection. During the inspection of the unit by internal investigating officials, the borrower directed them to a different locality where the unit was available but it was closed for more than six months. The unit was already mortgaged as collateral security to another loan favouring Vinayaka Paper Boards Limited., which had been declared as fraud,"" the bank officials said in a report.

"Hyderabad: It is quite possible that the four accused in the Disha case shot themselves during the alleged open firing on the morning of December 6, 2019, said counsel for Cyberabad police before the commission probing the killing of the accused in the Disha case, which has been described as ‘encounter killings’ allegedly at the behest of the then Cyberabad commissioner V.C. Sajjanar. The panel retorted that such fatal bullet wounds would only be caused by high-velocity weapons like SLRs and AK47s, and not 9mm pistols, the ones they allegedly snatched. Ballistics experts clarified that the wounds caused by bullets were bigger than could be caused by a 9mm pistol.  It became evident during arguments that police personnel fired 26 rounds in total, including 18 from AK47, four by Cyberabad SOT head constable Mohammed Sirajuddin and four by sub-inspector Kocherla Ravi. It was also ascertained that 10 AK 47 rounds were fired in the air as ‘warning shots’, while the remaining hit the four accused, Mohammed Arif, Jollu Shiva, Jollu Naveen and Ch. Chennakesavulu. The panel noted that the whole episode seemed more like a ‘take aim and shoot’ execution, unlike the version of officials, who deposed that it was a case of ‘firing at the sound of bullets’. The officials had told the panel that they were ordered to fire warning shots. They could not see the four accused as there was ‘soil in our eyes’.  However, the panel contended that in such a case, the wounds should have been on the legs or below the waist, whereas the bullets had pierced their torsos, suggesting that they did not wish to warn the accused. The commission wondered how no police person was injured when the accused ‘fired’ whereas bullets fired by police felled the four. The panel asked the counsel to provide documents or data showing how dark it was that morning as the official recorded sunrise timing was 6:31 am. State advocate Uma Maheshwar will continue the arguments on Thursday. ","['135', '197', '360', '227', '373']"

"Hyderabad: The Siddipet district revenue authorities are allegedly misleading the Telangana high court in a high-profile case of encroachment of assignment land as also government land in Sy No 356 of Pregnapur village in Gajwel mandal by a family of rich local landlords. Recently, hearing a case filed against these landlords, the HC directed the collectors of all the districts in Telangana to survey and geotag all the government lands to prevent encroachments and submit compliance reports to the court.  The case took an interesting turn with the petitioners again approaching the court with a complaint against the revenue authorities, stating that they have never taken possession of the land as claimed in their affidavit. Backed with evidence, the petitioners informed the court that even today the surplus land had been under the physical possession of the encroachers and the revenue department was not taking steps to resume the land and restore its ownership to the landless poor. Inquiries revealed that Chittapuram Raju, a resident of Pregnapur, filed a PIL in the HC complaining against local landlord Vijay Kumar and his daughter, who he said were in possession of 37 acres of land in Sy no 356, which was declared surplus land under the Agriculture Ceiling Act and later distributed this to the landless poor.  “The original landlords who declared surplus land retained their ownership and possession over the same land till date. Though the government allotted this land to the landless poor, the revenue records like pahani still showed the names of the original declarants,” said the petitioner. The tahasildar, in a report submitted to the then Medak collector, a copy of which is available with this newspaper, also categorically stated that Ac 37.09 was declared as ceiling surplus by M Laxmi Kantha Rao, M Vijay Kumar, M Veda Kumar and M Bhoopati Rao, and the same was assigned to 43 landless poor.  The report listed various sale transactions carried out by the original landowners even after the land was assigned to the landless poor. It also recommended to the collector to allow rectification of the records and protection of the government land. “We are also urging the court to issue necessary directions to evict the encroacher and hand over the possession to landless poor,” the petitioner said.","['111', '309', '210', '239AA', '369']"
"HYDERABAD: Various realtor bodies in Telangana raised their voices against the unscrupulous and unchecked mode of cheating the gullible customers in the name of registering undivided share of land, prelaunch and presale offers. Representatives of these real estate bodies including the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (Credai) on Friday appealed to the state government to immediately act against people indulging in illegal sale, that too presumptive, of the properties. They also expressed concern over the Telangana State Real Estate Regulatory Authority not acting firmly to put an end to the menace.  “It is no less than a cancer to the realty sector. The image of Hyderabad as the top real estate investment destination will soon be hit badly if the government fails to act now,” Credai Hyderabad president P. Ramakrishna Rao told media persons here. Explaining about the procedure adopted by individuals and companies, some of which are very popular in the city, Rao said the former made prospective flat buyers invest in the land first by promising to offer the finished flat at half the market price. While some amount would be given as advance to the landowner, the remaining would be invested elsewhere. “It is impossible to construct the project with the money they collected from the prospective buyers as a result of which there will be inordinate delay in launching the project. In some cases, they remain non-starters,” Rao pointed out.  C. Prabhakar Rao, president of Telangana Builders Federation, cautioned that the investor inland in the form of undivided share would not get protection from any of the statutory agencies because his status would change from the customer to that of a co-developer of the project. The RERA Act provides stringent action against the builder or developer for cheating the customers but those buying undivided share of land inadvertently become a developer and liable to be punished, he said. The realtors also wanted the RERA to find out such projects and notify besides initiating action to protect the interest of the buyers. Maintaining that they as advisory bodies would not have power to inspect the records of the companies indulging in the illegal practices, they said it would be easy for the government to detect such projects.  “The first alert will be in the form of hundreds of people coming for registration of extents as small as 40-50 sq yds,” they said adding that the RERA should immediately call for inspection of the records and bank accounts of the project developer and take necessary action. Ch. Ramachandra Reddy, chairman, Credai, Telangana, D. Murali Krishna Reddy, president Credai, Telangana, R. Chalapathi Rao, president, TREDA, G. V. Rao, president, Telangana Developers Association and V. Rajasekhar Reddy, general secretary, Credai, Hyderabad, were present. ","['214', '100', '239B', '352', '361A']"

"Bhopal: Police in Madhya Pradesh's Bhind district on Saturday registered a case against executive directors of Amazon India after busting a racket which allegedly sold ganja (cannabis) under the guise of selling a sweetener through the e-commerce platform. Amazon had said in a statement earlier that it does not allow sale of illegal products through its platform, and it was cooperating with the probe in the matter.  A case under section 38 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act was registered against executive directors of Amazon India which operates as ASSL in the country, Bhind Superintendent of Police Manoj Kumar Singh told PTI. The FIR did not mention any individual official by name, he said. Section 38 deals with the role of companies and their managements in an offence related to narcotic substances. A case was registered under the NDPS Act at Gohad police station in the district on November 13 after 21.7 kilograms of ganja was seized from Gwalior residents Bijendra Tomar and Suraj alias Kallu Pawaiya, the SP said.  Their questioning led to the arrest of Mukul Jaiswal, another Gwalior resident, and purchaser Chitra Balmiki, a resident of Mehgaon in Bhind, he said. The investigation revealed that Pawaiya and Jaiswal had formed a company named 'Babu Tex' and got it registered on Amazon as a seller, Singh said. They supplied ganja from Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh through the company under the guise of selling stevia, a plant-based sweetener, he said. Earlier this week, an Amazon spokesperson had said the company's platform enables third-party sellers to display, list and offer for sale products to customers directly.

"Hyderabad: Increasing cases of fuel thefts from parked trucks on highways have become a headache for the drivers and the owners alike. According to truck owners, a group of muggers break the fuel tank lock open and steal diesel using small pipes while the tired drivers are taking naps. As the Covid-19 restrictions have been eased, hundreds of trucks are moving along highways on a daily basis. The truck owners alleged that more than 50 such incidents of diesel thefts were taking place every day.  As per the statistics provided by the truck owners’ association, there are around 1.5 trucks and lorries in the state. Each lorry has a fuel tank with a capacity of 400 litres. Abdul Bari, member of Telangana Lorry Owners’ Association, who also owns lorries, said, “On Sunday, two of my lorries were targeted by these crooks in Peddapalli, on a highway, wherein around hundred litres of fuel was stolen.”
“More such incidents are taking place on the highways of Vijayawada and Warangal. The gangs which are involved in these activities are mostly from UP and Bihar. While trucks are parked, a small vehicle is intentionally parked beside these trucks. They insert a pipe in the tank by breaking its lock and fuel is sucked by the help of a motor. The whole process happens within minutes,” he said and added, “If the driver comes to know about the theft, these crooks attack the driver.”  Manchireddy Rajendar Reddy, president of this association, said such thefts are also committed by tea stall owners on highways. Some tea stalls that serve tea when these trucks are stopped, spike the tea and once the driver dozes, they empty half of the tank. Recently, two of such offenders have been apprehended by the police.” “These trucks basically generate revenue for the government as toll is paid for most of the routes. The authorities should provide safe parking areas for these trucks and lorries ensuring security and safety,” Rajendar Reddy said. ","['353', '124', '323A', '184', '323']"
"HYDERABAD: It was an unprecedented hearing that the Telangana High Court witnessed on Thursday laced with heated arguments when it took up the anticipatory bail petition of IAS trainee Mrugender Lal Banoth who has been charged with alleged rape of a woman at the National Police Academy (NPA) ending up with photos of a woman, said to be in the buff, being circulated leaving the victim in a state of shame and helplessness. However, on the request of the accused’s counsel that the future of the trainee officer will be at stake if he is arrested, Justice Lalitha granted 15-day interim bail ordering him to cooperate with the interrogation. The court also directed him to undergo a potency test.  The victim`s implead petition requesting the court to take up her contentions, too, before granting bail led to a twist in case. On Wednesday, Bhanoth’s counsel Devineni Radha Rani had argued that the rape case was lodged against her client as a counterblast by the victim as she was earlier booked in a case for circulating photos, allegedly in the nude, of the accused’s relative (woman) in a Telegram group she had created. The court was seeking the status of the case from the police. On Thursday, the police told the court that the phones and other electronic equipment with the obscene photos have been seized and sent to the forensic science laboratory (FSL) and a report was awaited. The police also submitted that seven witness were also examined in the rape case and they could not take further steps due to the court’s directions not to take any coercive steps against the accused.  Soon after, victim’s counsel S. Rajagopal stated that Bhanoth and his family were trying to mislead the court by cooking up a case against the victim and that photos purportedly in circulation were of the victim herself and not of Bhanoth’s cousin’s. He also submitted that before the case was registered against his client, Bhanoth’s father and former MLA Madan Lal and his wife visited the victim at her house to work out a compromise on two occasions. At this point, Bhanoth’s Counsel placed photos of the woman along with text messages and submitted that the victim impersonated as a male member of the Telegram group, and was forwarding photos of herself saying that it belongs to Bhanoth’s cousin.  Taking her defence further, she also quoted a Supreme Court observation that consensual sex with a promise of marriage does not amount to rape. Victim’s Counsel Rajagopal raised an objection and said that the Bhanoth’s Counsel was indulging in character assassination leadihg to some heated arguments. Interfering at this juncture, Justice Kanneganti Lalitha enquired with Assistant Public Prosecutor Md Vizarat about the FSL report. The Judge also questioned Bhanoth’s Counsel as to how a woman can circulate her own obscene photos and blame others. “Does any woman do such things?” She also asked, “What is the conduct of the trainee officer? Being a IPS trainee how could he go in for consensual sex and that too a the place of training? How will he go on to serve?”  The APP submitted that the FSL report would take time but submitted that the phone number from which the photos were forwarded was not in the name of the victim. However, the police had also booked another person as the second accused who had earlier used the same number. The APP also submitted that these two cases cannot be linked and citing a Supreme Court case said that the IAS trainee’s conduct amounts to rape and appealed to the court not to grant bail. Giving relief to Bhanoth’s parents, the court directed the police to issue notices to the parents if their presence is required. ","['352', '371D', '75', '228', '228A']"
